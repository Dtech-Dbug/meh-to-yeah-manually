# meh-to-yeah-manually

Thank you for considering me as a potential addition and progressing to the next round. I was glad after I recieved the followup mail right after I applied for the Front End Engineering role @ Manual.

I followed through just as I was asked to in the follow-up mail - answering the questions. But I feel I need to mention that I got carried away,talking about the technicalities ðŸ˜‚ and hence the duration of the recorded video is well over 10 minutes.

Just to be sure that I do not waste any of your valuable time, I decided to append summaries of the technical questions here as well as. 
And while you are at it , you can listen to [experience ðŸŽµ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VONMkKkdf4) - if you will. :D
